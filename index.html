            <h2>Decline of Black Farm Ownership</h2>
            <p>Black farm ownership throughout southern states has drastically declined since the late 1800s. This 
                fact is highlighted in the 1901 Du Bois census bureau data, which reported that there were 
                approximately 187,799 farms in the United States fully owned and operated by black farmers in 1900[1]. 
                By 1910, 45 years after Emancipation, black farmers had acquired over 15 million acres of farmland 
                and controlled approximately 218,000 Black farms [3].
                
                However, due to severe systemic discrimination, heir's property, and discriminatory lending 
                policies [2], there has been almost an 85% decrease in black farm ownership. Today, out of the 1,
                900,487 farms in the U.S., only 1.71% or 32,653, are black-owned, accounting for only 0.60% of 
                farmland in the country [3].
                </p>
            <h2>Importance of Black Centennial Farm Award Winners</h2>
            <p>Despite these challenges, Black farmers have historically been some of the most economically 
                independent leaders in their communities. The Georgia Centennial Farm Program was developed in 1993 
                to distinguish family farms that have contributed to preserving Georgia's agricultural history. To 
                apply for the award, farms must be at least 100 years old, at least 10 acres, and earn an annual 
                income of at least $1,000  [4,5]. Out of over 600 winners in the program since its inception, only 
                15 have been black.
                </p>
            <h2>Introducing Interactive Map & Timeline </h2>
            <p>We showcase these Black-owned Centennial Farms in our interactive map as a celebration for their 
                resilience and long-standing history, and ensure that the stories of Black agriculture remains a 
                part of the nation’s historical narrative. The map view on the right enables users to click on 
                markers to explore the stories of the awarded farms, which will display on the corresponding 
                timeline view in the left hand side. Feel free to click on the map directly, or use the forward and 
                back arrows to explore the farms awared in chronological order.
